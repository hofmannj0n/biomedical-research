# Biomedical Research Repository

This repository contains code and resources related to my research in the field of biomedical informatics.

## Projects

### Inspire Dataset Analysis
In the "inspire" folder, you'll find links to my research using the Inspire hospital dataset. I utilized machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, to predict whether breast cancer patients would pass away within 30 days of their operation. `inspire.ipynb` is the notebook used in my research for post-operative complications, all data related to cardiac patients is located in `cardiac outcomes`

### Medical Image Analysis
The "medical image analysis" folder contains code and resources related to my work in medical image analysis. I used PyTorch for semantic segmentation tasks, exploring various techniques for analyzing medical images.
